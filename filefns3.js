"Callback functions"
"callback function takes its last argument and invokes the operation asynchronously"
"Arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method"

"The first argument is always reserved for errors"
"If the operation is completed successfully then the first argument is null or undefined"

"The file functions are asynchronous"
"means it does not wait for the function to finish before calling append file we did not get"
"different values"
